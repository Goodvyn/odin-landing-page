# odin-landing-page

This project is a challenge presented by the odin project. My main goal is to copy the webpage design illustrated on the image provided.
Using fundamentals of HTML & CSS and Flexbox. Maybe in the future I will convert this to my landing page for my web-dev portfolio. 
Or just keep it as a part of my github repo portfolio, and create a different personal webpage later.
