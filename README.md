# odin-landing-page

## This project is a challenge presented by the odin project.

### The Landing Page Challenge
My main goal is to copy the webpage design illustrated on the image provided in this challenge,
using fundamentals of HTML & CSS and Flexbox.
### Future Plans
I have two options that I'm considering with this project:

1. Convert this to my landing page for my web-dev portfolio 
2. Keep it as a part of my github repo portfolio and create a different personal webpage later
